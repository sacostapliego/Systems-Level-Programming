Let me know
Do I still got time to grow?
Things ain't always set in stone
That be known let me know
Let me

Seems like, street lights, glowing happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in, the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, but I'm just not there

All the streets, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in, the cab and I paid my fare
See, I know my destination, but I'm just not there

In the streets
In the streets
I'm just not there in the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair

Seems like, street lights, glowing happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in, the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, but I'm just not there

All the streets, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in, the cab and I paid my fare
See, I know my destination, but I'm just not there

All the streets, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in, the cab and I paid my fare
See, I know my destination, but I'm just not there

In the streets
In the streets
I'm just not there in the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair
Life's just not fairSome day, some day
Some day I'll, I wanna wear a starry crown
Some day, some day
Some day I wanna lay down, like God did, on Sunday
Hold up, hold up
Some days, some days
I remember this on Sunday
Back way, yeah way, way
Some day, mmm, mmm
Some day, I wanna tell everybody, some days
I wanna hit the red dot, I'll never find
Some days, some
Each one, knowing how 'm livin', smokin' marijuana
Now I'm livin' high, doin' what I wanna, some days

I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

Some day we gon' set it off
Some day we gon' get this off
Baby, don't you bet it all
On a pack of Fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Some day the drama'll be gone
And they'll pray, it's not enough
Sometimes I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind
I'm on one, two, three, four, five
No half-truths, just naked minds
Caught between space and time
This not what we had in mind
But maybe some day

I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

Oh, once again I am a child
I let it all go (go), of everything that I know, yeah
Of everything that I know, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on the stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on the stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on the stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on the stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda freeWell, I had to know you
Oh (hello), oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah

The lower you drop, the more it's a fast fall
Notice how I'm on tour getting catcalled
Torturing squads, a- get a bad call
More than McGuire, couldn't afford to get blackballed
"Sort it with pops, " that's all that she asked for
All in this time, I fall through the trapdoor
All to remind me of horrors from the past wars
Trauma behind, I'm crawling with the mask torn
Boss had to find me, move on with your last-born
Untimely, I threw the maps on
But you still find me with the gas switch
A zombie, mixing stitches on the passport
The squad supplied, why I'm seein' life half short?
Can't recline but I ain't fiending much for fast-forward
The truth surprising, I can still be a bad sport
Hard to sympathize with taking dad's torch
Now I do the firing and take a lap for it
To seem inspiring to you would be a tad foolish
Still admire it

Oh, let me show you
I think that I could love you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, just ain't go, baby
Ooh (Ooh), oh, oh
Do you think, baby?
Yeah, yeah, yeah (hello)
Hello, hello (hello)
Baby, he-he-he (hello)
Baby, oh-oh-oh (hello), hello
Hello (hello)
Baby (hello), hello, hello, hello
Baby (hello), hello, hello, helloHold on, hold on, that, 
Hold on, I got to start this record over again, wait a minute
That, still on this record
I'ma play this for y'all
Ay, y'all get some more drinks goin' on, I'll sound a whole lot better

Listen
Seein' you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart, yeah
Tension
Between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

Listen
Harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

Um, trying to think of the right thing to sayDream
Just dream
Long ago, long ago, long ago
Dream
Just dream
Dream

Are we still friends?
Can we be friends?
Are we still friends?
I've got to kn-, know
If we can see each other
Shake your hand, say hi
Long ago, long ago, long ago

I can't stop you, I can't rock too
I've been back there and I can not die too
But I've got to know

Are we still friends? Can we be friends?
Are we still friends? Can we be- (can we be friends?)
Are we still friends? Can we be friends? (Yeah)
Are we still friends?
Are we still friends? Are we still friends?
Are we still friends? Are we still friends?
Are we still friends? (Friends, friends)
I said, are we still friends? (Friends, friends)
Are we still friends? (Friends, friends, friends, friends, friends)

Don't get green skin (green skin), keep contact (keep contact)
Don't say, "Goodbye, smell you later" (bye, later)
Nah, I can't
I don't want to end this season on a bad episode, nigga, nah

Bouncing off things and you don't know how you fall
Your power is drained, so you cannot go through walls
You're caught in this matrix, don't know where you play it
You hate it, it could be your favorite if you make it your friend

Are we still friends? (This can't end)
Are we still friends? Are we still friends? (I still wanna say hi)
Are we, are we, are we, are we still friends?
Oh whoa

Can't say goodbye (check it, ahh)
Can't say goodbye, goodbye (woo)
