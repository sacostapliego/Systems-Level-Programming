Well, I had to know you
Oh (hello), oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah

The lower you drop, the more it's a fast fall
Notice how I'm on tour getting catcalled
Torturing squads, a- get a bad call
More than McGuire, couldn't afford to get blackballed
"Sort it with pops, " that's all that she asked for
All in this time, I fall through the trapdoor
All to remind me of horrors from the past wars
Trauma behind, I'm crawling with the mask torn
Boss had to find me, move on with your last-born
Untimely, I threw the maps on
But you still find me with the gas switch
A zombie, mixing stitches on the passport
The squad supplied, why I'm seein' life half short?
Can't recline but I ain't fiending much for fast-forward
The truth surprising, I can still be a bad sport
Hard to sympathize with taking dad's torch
Now I do the firing and take a lap for it
To seem inspiring to you would be a tad foolish
Still admire it

Oh, let me show you
I think that I could love you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, just ain't go, baby
Ooh (Ooh), oh, oh
Do you think, baby?
Yeah, yeah, yeah (hello)
Hello, hello (hello)
Baby, he-he-he (hello)
Baby, oh-oh-oh (hello), hello
Hello (hello)
Baby (hello), hello, hello, hello
Baby (hello), hello, hello, hello
